title: Fall 2020 Update
---

The college has announced their [re-opening plan for the fall semester](https://stevenscollege.edu/fall-2020/). CSET and six other programs will be fully remote, including gen-ed classes. Our program will be one of the easiest to convert to an online-only setup, but it will still take some time to iron out any kinks.

The college will post announcements or changes to the plan at that website. Be sure to check your college email account for updates as well.
