The move to distance learning requires all synchronous class activities to be conducted on Zoom. These activities include lectures, full class discussions, and review sessions. Download the [Zoom client here](https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting). In order for this to be most effective, follow these guidelines:

- Treat Zoom like the actual classroom. Don't do anything that you wouldn't do in person.
- Assume every class session is synchronous through Zoom unless told otherwise. Be ready to join the call at least 5 minutes before class starts to be on time. 
- During the call, keep your video on to participate in the class.[^1]
- And lastly, keep yourself muted unless called on to speak.

In addition to Zoom, we use Slack for all of our asynchronous activities.[^2] This includes chat messages, group work, and sharing links and resources. During a Zoom call, keep Slack open so you can type questions, upvote them, provide answers, or other synchronous tasks.

[^1]: Keeping video on helps create a sense of community and keeps you actively engaged in the class, increasing your participation. But I'm also aware that everyone has different situations. We can work out accomodations if needed.
