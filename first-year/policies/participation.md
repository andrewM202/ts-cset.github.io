As a student, the effort you put in determines what you get out of your college experience. But as an adult, it's your choice to do the work in order to get the results. The three most important ways you can show this effort are to:

1. Be Prepared
2. Be Present
3. Be Curious

Participation is graded weekly. It is your responsibility to communicate to the instructor anything that might affect your participation grade **before** you receive it. We can work together to find a solution, but only if you take the initiative to tell me in advance. The only exceptions are for school approved excuses for abscence (e.g. medical emergency).

Here are some examples of these expectations in class used in the grading rubric.


## Exceed Expectations

1. Student regularly arrives on time with all materials needed and is ready to begin at the start of class.
2. Student actively contributes to class with thoughtful comments, listens carefully to instruction, and participates in group work.
3. Student regularly asks interesting questions and actively seeks new challenges, resources, and connections between ideas.

## Meet Minimum Expectations

1. Student is mostly on time or communicative if unable. They usually have all needed materials for class time.
2. Student passively participates by following instruction or taking notes, only occasionally participating with comments or reactions
3. Student regularly asks helpful questions when in need but doesn't seek new ideas on their own.

## Below Expectations

1. Student is frequently late or absent, missing work. They occasionally don't have the materials needed to participate in class.
2. Student is mainly passive, physically present but mentally elsewhere. Doesn't contribute actively.
3. Student doesn't ask for help, even when in need.

## Unacceptable

1. Student is frequently late or absent and uncommunicative, missing work or refusing to complete it later. The student regularly does not have materials to participate in class.
2. Student is disruptive, disrespectful, or otherwise detrimental to other students' participation.
3. Student asks irrelevant or repetitive questions when they have resources to find the answers.
