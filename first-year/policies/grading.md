Most of the course work for CSET classes can be grouped into one of three categories: Projects, Participation, and Assessments. Since the goal of the program is to prepare you for a career, the grading breakdown in each class should reflect that goal. Projects measure how well you can do the work. Participation measures your level of professionalism while doing that work. And Assessments show that you understand it and can communicate about it.

## Projects

Each week, there will be a variety of assignments to practice what you are learning in lectures or readings. A majority will not be graded. We'll review them together and I'll provide feedback, but they're really just for practice.

One graded project will be due at the end of every week. This wraps up all the major concepts of the week into a real world example. Each will be graded differently according to a rubric given beforehand.


## Participation

You also receive a participation grade each week. This helps you stay active and engaged in the learning process. It's a measure of your level of professionalism, so treat each class like it's your job and you'll do fine. For example, you wouldn't skip a shift at work without letting your manager know. And if you showed up but didn't do the work, you'd be fired. The goal of the program is to train you to be a professional software developer, right?

## Assessments

In the working world, you won't need to have everything memorized if you know how to use your resources and look up what you need to know. So it doesn't make sense to rely on tests and quizzes that measure how much you can memorize. Instead, I'll assess your understanding through short writing prompts due at the end of each week. You'll answer open ended questions about the concepts we were just learning.

One of the first barriers to getting a job when you graduate is the interview process. Even if you know everything you need to get the job, you won't be hired if you can't communicate it. So these assessments are your chance to practice talking about what you know. Here's [the grading rubric for assessments](/first-year/policies/assessments) if you want more details.
