Tests and quizzes are sometimes a better measure of your ability to memorize than your ability to understand concepts. On the job, you can always look up things you haven't memorized as long as you know how to use them. But before you get that job, you have to ace the interview. So part of your grade is your ability to answer questions about concepts, and I'll be looking for three things:

1. Clear Ideas
2. Supporting Evidence
3. Professional Language

Each week will have a graded assessment, a written response to two or three open ended questions. These are styled just like an interviewer would ask. They might ask you to provide an opinion, or they might ask you to explain a concept you learned that week. Here are the requirements:

- **Plain text file**, not a Word or Google Doc.
- **At least 300 words**, but you should write as much as you need to anser the questions. For reference, this page is over 400 words. 
- **Submitted to GitHub** in your `cset` repository in the appropriate course directory, and named `assessment-X.md` where `X` is the week of the course. For example, the second week of CSET-110 should be saved at `cset/110/assessment-2.md`.
- __Failure to follow the naming convention can result in a failing grade.__

It is your responsibility to communicate to the instructor anything that might affect your ability to submit the assessment **before** it is due. We can work together to find a solution, but only if you take the initiative to tell me in advance. The only exceptions are for school approved excuses for abscence (e.g. medical emergency).

Here are some examples of my expectations used in the grading rubric.


## Exceed Expectations

1. Student rephrased the question and clearly stated their opinion or explanation.
2. Student provided plenty of examples to support their ideas and with potential conterpoints.
3. Student's language was professional in bearing, without any typos or grammatical errors. Student also used proper Markdown formatting.

## Meet Minimum Expectations

1. Student stated their ideas, but weren't clear about their intent.
2. Student provided some supporting evidence, but didn't cover all cases or any counterpoints.
3. Student's language was mostly professional, with only a few mistakes that didn't affect the meaning.

## Below Expectations

1. Student's answer was unclear, confusing, or redundant.
2. Student attempted to provide evidence, but it was incorrect or unsupportive.
3. Student's language had too many grammatical errors or mistakes, potentially causing even more confusion.

## Unacceptable

1. Student didn't share their own ideas but restated ideas from class materials or other students.
2. Student didn't bother to provide examples.
3. Student didn't meet the minimum length requirement.
