## First Semester

The goal of this semester is to learn how to build interfaces. You've used programs and websites all your life, now you get to figure out how to design and program them. You'll learn some foundational skills in computational and programmatic thinking as you build the _front end_ of an application, the part that your users will interact with.

- [CSET-105: Intro to Web Applications](https://ts-cset.github.io/cset-105)
- [CSET-110: Web Development I](https://ts-cset.github.io/cset-110)
- [CSET-115: Technical Requirements &amp; Data Structures](https://ts-cset.github.io/cset-115)
- [CSET-120: Software Project I](https://ts-cset.github.io/cset-120)


## Second Semester

Now you'll delve into the _back end_ of your websites and power them with data. You'll learn about web servers, databases, and cybersecurity to turn your static web pages into dynamic fully-functioning web applications. You'll also be introduced to different programming languages so you can see how to solve problems in different ways.

- [CSET-155: Database Design](https://ts-cset.github.io/cset-155)
- [CSET-160: Web Development II](https://ts-cset.github.io/cset-160)
- [CSET-170: Security &amp; Professional Ethics](https://ts-cset.github.io/cset-170)
- [CSET-180: Software Project II](https://ts-cset.github.io/cset-180)


## Third Semester

Your second year will teach you to pull apart the back end of an application into separate services, called APIs. You'll learn to integrate with third-party services, like maps, weather, and social media platforms. And you'll start practicing soft skills to communicate in the workplace.

- CSET-205: Advanced Data Integration
- CSET-210: Workplace Communications
- CSET-222: Database Management Systems
- CSET-220: Software Project III


## Fourth Semester

For your final semester, you'll learn to develop mobile applications that can connect to those APIs as well as a deeper understanding of advanced computer science concepts. The year will wrap up with a final project pulling together everything you've learned throughout the program.

- CSET-260: Software Principles
- CSET-270: Mobile Development
- CSET-280: Capstone Project
